# Airbnb Database - Seeding Script

## Overview
This script populates the Airbnb database with **sample data** for testing and demonstration.  
The data is **minimal** (2–3 rows per table) but ensures that all entities and relationships are covered:
- Users (guest, host, admin)
- Properties
- Bookings
- Payments
- Reviews
- Messages

This allows developers to test queries, relationships, and constraints without overloading the database.
